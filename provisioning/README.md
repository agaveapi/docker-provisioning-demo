# Provisioning

Before we can do much of anything, we need some hardware to do it on. Agave doesn't care where or what your hardware is, it will work with whatever you have wherever it's at without requiring you to install anything. In this section we will show you how to provision virtual machines that we will use in the next section on [Running Apps](../running/README.md). We give you examples of provisioning compute and storage on Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure, but feel free to use whatever cloud provider you like. The only requirement is that the resources you provide are visible by the Agave host machines.
