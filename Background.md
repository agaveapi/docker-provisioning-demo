  *your own, shared, or commercial systems*

* ...and manage your data

  *reliable, multi-protocol, async data movement*

* ...from the web

## What is Docker

[Docker](http://docker.com) is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. In the context of computational science, it enables application codes and even entire workflows to be quickly assembled from components and stored in a way that promotes openness, reproducibility, and collaboration. Docker is open source and backed by both Docker, Inc. and a vibrant open source community. For more information on Docker, consult the official website at [http://docker.com](http://docker.com).
